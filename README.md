BestPhoneSpy Explains How Spy App Works

Cell phone spy software, also known as spy app, is a mobile app that secretly monitors and obtains information from target phones. It records phone calls, text messages and other sensitive information. All recorded data is sent to the appâ€™s server. The spy app runs in the background and cannot be detected by users.
