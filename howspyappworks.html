	<title>How Does Spy App Work?</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Cell phone spy software, also known as spy app, is a mobile app that secretly monitors and obtains information from target phones. It records phone calls, text messages and other sensitive information. All recorded data is sent to the app¡¯s server. The spy app runs in the background and cannot be detected by users.</p>
